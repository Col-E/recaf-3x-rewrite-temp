# Temporary 3X rewrite repo

While working on refactoring to 3X to support CDI and much more, there were too many things wrong with the existing structure.

So here we are. 

Rewriting the base, _again._ 
Then once the new base is set-up, copying all the work on the existing 3X branch into the new design, then putting it back on `dev3` on the main repo.
